# This SPARQL query retrieves a list of given names used by at least 10 people in Wikidata,
# where each person is an instance of "human" (wd:Q5), and the given name is an instance of "given name" (wd:Q202444).
#
# For each qualifying given name, the query returns:
# - The Wikidata URI of the given name
# - The extracted QID (e.g. Q1234) of the given name
# - The label of the given name (human-readable name)
# - The number of people who share this given name
# - A concatenated list of Wikidata person URIs who have this name
# - A concatenated list of their corresponding human-readable labels
#
# The subquery limits to 3,000 unique personâ€“given name pairs to maintain performance.
