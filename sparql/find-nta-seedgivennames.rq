# This SPARQL query retrieves given names from Wikidata that are used by at least 5 people (with NTA identifiers),
# and returns the following for each name:
# - The Wikidata entity ID (QID) of the given name
# - The label (human-readable name) of the given name
# - A count of how many people share that given name
# - A list of person URIs (Wikidata entities) who have that given name
# - A list of their labels (names)
# - A list of all NTA identifiers associated with those people
#
# The data is filtered to only include given names that are instances of the class "given name" (wd:Q202444).
# The subquery retrieves up to 600,000 distinct person–name–NTA combinations to reduce load.
